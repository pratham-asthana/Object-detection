## Features

- **Pre-trained Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art pre-trained models from Torchvision, including Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet.
- **Custom Training**: Offers support for training on custom datasets with configurable hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implements evaluation metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP) for model performance assessment.
- **Real-time Inference**: Provides scripts for real-time object detection on images, videos, and webcam feeds.
- **Modular Design**: Structured in a modular way, allowing easy customization and extension of the pipeline.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection.git
cd object-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Dataset Preparation

To train the model on your custom dataset, organize your data in the following structure:

dataset/
│
├── train/
│ ├── images/
│ └── annotations/
├── val/
│ ├── images/
│ └── annotations/
└── test/
├── images/
└── annotations/


Ensure that annotations are in a compatible format, such as COCO or Pascal VOC. You can modify the dataset loading script in `datasets.py` to accommodate different formats.

### Training

Customize the `config.yaml` file to specify your dataset path, model type, learning rate, and other hyperparameters. Then, start the training process with the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```
## Results

The model's performance has been evaluated on various test cases. Below are some sample results showcasing the model's ability to detect and classify objects accurately:

### Sample Images
